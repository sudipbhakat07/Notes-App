# Notes-App

I have made an android Notes App, where we can add notes which will be stored  in the database and will be displayed in a recycler view.
We can update and delete a note, just by clicking on the note from the list.

You can run this Android app on Appetize.io [here](https://appetize.io/app/22qc950hbzezr2t5n82avhnr5r?device=nexus5&scale=75&orientation=portrait&osVersion=8.1)
